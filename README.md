physics-cards
==========

I like the way physics based UI's look in games like hearthstone.

I want to try doing that in Javascript

This is still a work in progress. Some things I want to add:

- [ ] Depth - I think it would look nice if the cards existed in the Z as well as the X and Y
- [ ] Dragging, sorting and reordering the cards
- [ ] Small code cleanup. It's not too bad at the moment but there is a bunch of confusing boilerplate
